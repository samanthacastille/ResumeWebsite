		<p>I’m a senior in Computer Science at the University of Louisiana concentrating in mathematics and electrical engineering. I’m also a math tutor, a computer science tutor, and I’ve worked in customer service for the last 10 years. I will be graduating with my Bachelor's degree in December 2021, and I'm currently looking for a full-time Software Engineering role in the Seattle, WA area.</p>
		<br />

		<p>I would describe myself as a creative thinker, fast learner, and highly organized. I always bring a positive attitude to any setting. I am confident in my public speaking skills and my ability to communicate my ideas to people in technical and non-technical roles.</p>
